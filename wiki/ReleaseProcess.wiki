#summary How to make a new innotop release

  # Check out the whole SVN repository, including branches and trunk.
  # Update the Changelog.
  # Update 'our $VERSION' inside of innotop.
  # commit.
  # svn cp trunk into branches, commit again.
  # export a clean copy to omit the .svn directory and rename it, e.g. `svn export branches/stable-1.8.0/ innotop-1.8.0`
  # tarball that, e.g. `tar vzcf innotop-1.8.0.tar.gz innotop-1.8.0/`
  # upload it, blog it, announce it on twitter, whatever.
