## innotop has moved to github: https://github.com/innotop/innotop ##

innotop is a 'top' clone for MySQL with many features and flexibility.

  * completely customizable; it even has a plugin interface
  * monitors many servers at once and can aggregate across them

The manual is embedded into the program in Perl's POD format, so it should be available through `perldoc` and `man`, and is also [available online](http://innotop.googlecode.com/svn/html/index.html).
